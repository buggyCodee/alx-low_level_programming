# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Resources

- [Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)
- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/)

## General
- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. `0x03-debugging`), describing what this project is about

## Tasks

<summary><a href="./0-main.c">0. Multiple mains</a></summary><br>

In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a `postitive_or_negative()` function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.h
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

void positive_or_negative(int i);

#endif /* MAIN_H */
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ 
```

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./a.out
98 is positive
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$

```

Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.

You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from `0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0` to compile with this main file to test locally.

- You only need to upload `0-main.c` and `main.h` for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
- You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./0-main
0 is zero
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 1-main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ 
```
