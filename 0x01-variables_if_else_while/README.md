### man or help:

- `ascii` (You do not need to learn about `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, functions.)

## Learning Objectives

### General

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables with the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`
- What is the `ASCII` character set
- What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`


## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)


## Tasks

<details>
<summary><a href="./0-positive_or_negative.c">0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing</a></summary><br>

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
        - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        - if the number is 0: `is zero`
        - if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    - followed by a new line
